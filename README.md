This repo explores various classification models available in scikit learn for predicting transition propensity for progression of a rare disease to next stage for an Health Economics and Outcomes Research project.This was need to build Cost Effectiveness model for a drug in clinical trial phase III for its approval. This required collecting clinical trial data from graphs/tables available in research papers and oversampling the dataset. I tried Logistic, SVM, RF, XGB models and chose SVM with best test accuracy.
